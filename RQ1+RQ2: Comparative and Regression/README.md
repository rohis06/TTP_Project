**RQ1: Besides streaming music, are “musicians” associated with better mental health conditions?** 

To address this question, we will compare the mental health conditions of musicians and non-musicians. Comparative testing approaches, including t-tests and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), will be employed to determine if there are significant differences in mental health outcomes between these groups.

**RQ2: What are the individual characteristics associated with mental well-being?** 

This question seeks to identify specific individual characteristics that correlate with mental well-being. We will perform regression modeling and inferential analysis using various feature selection techniques to pinpoint the most influential factors.
